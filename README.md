# Sugar Developer Office Hours - Code sharing
This project is used to share code we cooked up and showed in our Developer Office Hours.

You can always rewatch our Webinar Sessions available on our [Event Recaps](https://sugarclub.sugarcrm.com/dev-club/m/event-recaps) session in DevClub.

## Project Structure
When code is used in our sessions, it will be shared and made available using the month/year of the session in the table below.
